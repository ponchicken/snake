# Coding_Challenge-7

This coding challenge is all about **working in teams**. No matter how many tutorials, books, and exercises you do, most employers want to know that you have worked in teams before, and that you are able to work well with their developers. In addition, you will find that having somebody to work with opens up new possibilities and makes you a better programmer because you have somebody to bounce ideas off of while combining your programming skills. Use this challeneg to work with version control using Git + Github (see these sections in the course if you are unfamiliar with them), and try to accomplish this challenge that is quite difficult... but definitely doable.

Please Use the **#coding-challenge** channel to discuss and share your work. At the end of the challenge, I will compile everyone's submitted answers onto github.(Ps, try to solve these yourselves before going out on the internet and finding a copy paste solution)

## What is the Challenge?

Build a snake game! This is a very personal project for me. Back in the day when I first started learning Javascript, I attempted to build a snake game. I couldn't do it. I eventually had to go online and look at other people's solution to see how to do it. After seeing the solutions, I regretted not spending more time thinking logically about the problem and solving it myself... if only I was doing this with a coding buddy....

It's time for you to build your own snake game like this: http://patorjk.com/games/snake/ (and add your own twist to it). It may seem impossible at first, but I promise you that if you break down the game into small logical problems and steps, anyone who has done the HTML, CSS and Javascript portion of the course can do it. Luckily for you, you will also be working with a partner! Try to build this game using only plain HTML, CSS and Javascript (no libraries please). 

## Finding A Partner:

This coding challenge is all about working in teams. You can work with anywhere from 1~4 partners (teams of 2~5). You can either work with your programming buddy (which you should have if you followed the instructions in the intro section of the course), or you can find new **#programming-buddies** in the Discord channel. Another option is to actually go to the Locals on Discord and work with people in your area. I know a few people wanting to organize Local meetups and this is a great project to get started with meetups. If you need any help with this to spread the word for your area, please let me know on Discord. **Finding a partner is your responsibility and I cannot help pair people together. Reaching out to others and forming teams is part of the exercise**

## The Rules Are:

1. **You have until July 31st at 11:59pm EST** to submit your solution file (using Github. If you don't know how to do that, check out the lecture in the Git + Github section of the course). You will have to submit the link to the **#coding-challenge** Discord group with the following message:  -challenge github.com/<username>/<repo> . The bot will listen for the command in any channel its in and will reply with "thanks for your submission" if it succeeded. Please provide the github names of all of your team members in the message so that I can compile the coding challenge submissions at the end of July.  

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and build something that will be challenging. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 

*** **Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I recieve from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
